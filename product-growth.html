      <p class="paragraph-8"><strong>TLDR</strong>:¬†Implemented go-to-market strategy to grow from 0 to $15k MRR in 6 months.<strong><br><br>Role</strong>:¬†Head of Product, Growth<strong><br><br>KPI</strong>: User Acquisition, Monetization<br></p>
      <h4 class="work-page-headers"><strong class="work-page-headers">Overview</strong></h4>
      <p class="work-page-p">Trym had a strong base of barbers on the platform with a set of early adopters. Our next step was to build a go-to-market strategy to generate more demand and meet our growth goals.<br><br>I was in charge of bringing Trym to the market of 447,000 men in San Francisco.<br><br>My goal was to:<br>- Grow revenue<br>- Establish 3:1 LTV CAC ratio<br>- Increase Average Revenue Per User</p>
      <h4 class="work-page-headers">Research</h4>
      <p class="work-page-p">The first step was researching our users and product to ensure we had the right approach to support our go-to-market strategy. <br><br>Typically, products grow via content, virality, performance marketing, or sales. <br><br>To determine which was the right sustainable growth lane for Trym, I looked to: <br><br>- User data ‚Äî where our product is placed in users&#x27; lives and where it stands in their habits?<br>- Our business model ‚Äî what makes sense regarding how do we make money?<br><br>The key insights we had gained from the early alpha and beta users was that finding an appointment when you needed one (often last-minute) was nearly impossible. At this moment, they searched online for a solution and booked with us.<br><br>This key insight combined with our transaction-based business model pointed to performance marketing.<br><br>Moving forward I sat down with the engineering and design department to research the following variables in our data:<br><br>- Target: considering our data, where is the common pattern and where may we find more of these users.<br>‚Äç<br>- User testing: I spoke with more users and reviewed notes to identify what common habits our users had, the key moment they decided to book an appointment, and how they heard of us.<br>‚Äç<br>- New vs returning behavior: using cohort analysis and user interviews, I identified the types of users that were booking multiple haircuts vs those who booked just once.<br>‚Äç<br>- Funnels: to ensure inbound users weren‚Äôt falling through the cracks, I analyzed drop-offs using product analytics and closed the gaps (more on this here).<br>‚Äç<br>- Devices: I reviewed user behavior between device types and operating systems to ensure we had consistency.<br>‚Äç<br>- Geography: I broke down users by their zip codes to identify where our most valuable users are coming from.<br>‚Äç<br>- Time of day: analyzing the time of day users visited our website, when they submitted booking, and what time they preferred their appointment offered a lot of insight.<br></p>
      <h4 class="work-page-headers">Problems &amp;¬†Solutions</h4>
      <p class="work-page-p">After combing and analyzing the takeaways from the research phase, I created an experiment matrix hypothesizing on what delivers the highest conversions with the lowest cost.<br>‚Äç<br>Experiments:<br><br>- Marketing channels<br>Google Ads<br>Facebook<br>Instagram<br>YouTube<br>LinkedIn<br>Twitter<br><br>- Messaging<br>Premium<br>Convenience<br>Scheduling<br><br>- Pricing<br>$59<br>$79<br>$99<br><br>- Pricing model<br>One fee<br>Fee + tip<br>Fee + tip + service fee<br>Fee + commute fee<br><br>- Landing page design<br>Modern<br>Classic<br>Length<br><br>- Funnel length/flow<br>3 steps<br>5 steps<br>8 steps<br><br>- Call to action<br>Book Now<br>Schedule Now<br>Find barbers<br><br>- Imagery<br>Male/Female barber<br>Home<br>Office<br>Hotel<br>Shave, Haircut, Trim<br><br>- Marketing communication<br>Drip marketing a/b tests such as timing, messaging, content etc.<br>Channel: email, text, chat<br><br>- Referral incentives<br>$10<br>$20<br>$50<br>Free services<br>Group services<br>Timing</p>
      <h4 class="work-page-headers">Iteration &amp; Validation<br></h4>
      <p class="work-page-p">I ran 40 experiments to ensure the winning combination was implemented into our product. To build sustainable growth we needed to have the right support with stellar conversion, activation, and retention.<br><br>Each marketing channel had campaigns/ad groups containing variants to determine where each fell on the demand curve. <br><br>The marketing channels pushed inbound traffic into varies variants which were then used to determine the CAC per combination. I ensured that the experiments didn‚Äôt influence each other so that our results weren‚Äôt skewed. To do so I ran MVT experiments only when I was measuring the same metric within the group, the same flow, and the same length. If those 3 rules didn‚Äôt match then the experiments were separated. <br><br>After a few months we had enough data to determine the winning formula:<br><br>- Google Ads based on select winning keywords, ad copy, timing, demographics etc.<br>- Re-marketing for abandoned booking traffic.<br>- Quality for website messaging.<br>- $79 price for the optimal demand curve<br>- Fee + tip for the pricing model.<br>- Modern landing page with 6 sections: covid safety, barbers, how it works, reviews, pricing, FAQ<br>- 8 step funnel length (read more here)<br>- Book Now for the CTA<br>- Male barber, beard trim for image<br>- Email + text drip campaign<br>- $50 referral incentive with two referrals, after service completion<br><br>Although we had the right formula for increasing our revenue, it was important to ensure these were quality users with desirable Average Revenue Per User. It took a few additional months of cohort analysis to where the most quality leads were coming from, from there I made additional optimizations for our outreach along with further product adjustments.</p>
      <h4 class="work-page-headers">Outcome</h4>
      <p class="work-page-p">After 4 months of customer development and experimentation, I had identified the winning go-to-market strategy to scale Trym. <br><br>I was able to achieve:<br><br>- $15k MRR in 6 months (20% CMGR)<br>- 65% drop in CAC resulting in 3:1 LTV CAC<br>- Increased ARPU from $98.75 to $256.75</p>
