<h1>Product Strategy</h1>

<h2 class="work-page-headers">Strategy: the fundamental pillar for quality product development</h2>
<p class="work-page-p">Today the leading indicator of company success is the quality of the product. Building quality products requires rigorous prioritization decisions. Quality teams understand how to do this repeatedly to reach their company mission, but many teams don't. The differentiating factor is often a clear understanding of strategy.</p>
<h2><strong>Where teams go wrong</strong></h2>
<p class="work-page-p">Difficulty prioritizing effectively is a symptom of a strategy issue, not an execution issue. When many hear strategy they think &quot;vision&quot;, &quot;goals&quot;, &quot;roadmap&quot;, but there isn't as much clarity across the cross-functional team as there should be.</p>
<p class="work-page-p">This makes answering prioritization questions hard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I prioritize building a new feature or optimize the existing funnel?</li>
<li>Should I prioritize reach more users or closing more deals?</li>
</ul>
<p class="work-page-p">This also leaks into other hard to diagnose areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miscommunication with teams</li>
<li>Product-market fit saturation</li>
<li>Negative impact on team morale</li>
</ul>
<p class="work-page-p">This can all be resolved when the strategy is clearly defined, well communicated, and connected to the company's mission and it's day-to-day work.</p>
<h2>How to create a coherent product strategy</h2>
<p class="work-page-p">To fix the issues I mentioned above, we have to clearly define the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company Mission</strong> - The world your company sees and the change it wants to bring to that world.
<ul>
<li>Great companies seek to align strategic initiatives to their mission.Your company mission should only change as the company's worldview changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Company Strategy</strong> - The logical plan you have to bring your company’s mission into being.
<ul>
<li>Should be rigorously logical, and should account for the company's position in the market, unique strengths and risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Product Strategy</strong> - The logical plan for how the product will drive its part of the company strategy.
<ul>
<li>An effective product strategy cannot exist in isolation - e.g. Slack and Discord have similar products but have a vastly different company mission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Product Roadmap</strong> - The sequence of features that implement the Product Strategy.
<ul>
<li>Helps teams focus on long-term value creation for customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Product Goals</strong> - The quarterly and day-to-day outcomes of the Product Roadmap that measure progress against the Product Strategy.
<ul>
<li>Roadmaps and goals must be tethered to product and company strategy rather than defined in isolation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="work-page-p">Each layer is a prerequisite to the one above it. Two approaches to creating this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top-down: great for defining/planning strategy</li>
<li>Bottom-up: great for evaluation/executing strategy</li>
</ul>
<p class="work-page-p">Moving forward: create various functional strategies for technology, marketing, design, operations and other functions. Combined, all disciplines of the company will ladder up to interconnect with the wider company strategy and goal.</p>
<p class="work-page-p">Lastly, I believe it's important to share the entire strategy with all team members in the company. This creates transparency and alignment needed for day-to-day tasks.</p>
