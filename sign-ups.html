      <h4 class="work-page-headers"><strong class="work-page-headers">Overview</strong></h4>
      <p class="work-page-p">Trym offered men the ability to book in home haircuts before, during, or after the barber shop&#x27;s operating hours. We managed {%} conversion rate on all visitors, but with thousands of men looking a quality haircut, we had to improve our conversion rate to better scale. ¬†<br><br>Improving our conversion rate would improve our unit economics and allow us to reach thousands of more users. Our funnel was resulting in high customer acquisition costs. Furthermore as we scaled it was important to maintain a 3:1¬†LTV/CAC ratio.<br><br>If we were able to improve our funnel, then we&#x27;d also be able to improve the earnings for our barbers and get closer to reaching network effects. <br><br>I worked with our team of engineers and designers to isolate the source of the problem and to fill in the holes with either a new or improved funnel.<br><br>The objective was to:<br>- Increase booked appointments<br>- Increase the conversion rater per user<br>- Reduce customer acquisition costs</p><h4 class="work-page-headers">Research</h4><p class="work-page-p">The first step for us was to start with quantitative analysis which allows us to identify the source of the drop offs. ¬†To start we used an audit on using our product analytics to determine where exactly users may be falling off. <br><br>I identified the following steps where users fell off:<br><br>- 73% fell off at our home page<br>- 12% fell off at date selector<br>- 49%¬†fell off at sign up<br><br>Now that we had identified where users decided to stop using Trym, we could dig deeper with qualitative analysis. We did this by holding cross-functional meetings to review Trym&#x27;s user experience using Digital Experience Intelligence tools, analyzing the support tickets users created, and conducting user interviews. <br><br>During this process I interviewed 25 users who had not booked and 25 users who had successfully booked. This helped identify the following insights:<br><br><strong>Matching<br>‚Äç</strong>Our booking process didn‚Äôt include an option to select a barber. While we made this choice to prioritize convenience, this made it hard for users to close the deal at checkout.<br>‚Äç<br>‚Äç<strong>Appointment clarity<br>‚Äç</strong>It wasn‚Äôt clear if upon booking, if the barber would indeed arrive at that select time. We had offered users the ability to select any time in the week and pay prior to confirmation. Furthermore, barbers often required more wiggle room to arrive at the appointment. Both sides of the marketplace had trouble with this step.<br>‚Äç<br>‚Äç<strong>How it works<br>‚Äç</strong>Our landing page didn‚Äôt cover all the aspects of the in home haircut process. Now that we had started to expand upon our eager early adopters, many users who signed up but didn‚Äôt book wanted to learn more.<br><br>‚Äç<strong>Rebooking<br>‚Äç</strong>Furthermore, we uncovered a problem with returning users who were having trouble booking for a second time with their favorite barber. The existing option in their account was hard to find by our users.<br></p><div class="html-embed w-embed"><html>

    	<b>Transparency</b>
    </td>
    <td>
    	<b>Messaging at checkout</b>
      <br>
				At checkout we can improve our messaging prior to payment by letting our users know that they will not be charged yet until the barber accepts their request and what they do after to prepare. This may ease concerns regarding booking and payment reducing drop offs at checkout.    	
        <br>
        <br>
    	<b>Availability vs Date</b>
      <br>
				Rather than selecting one specific time for a haircut, users can share their availability window. Theoretically, this increases our ability to match requests successfully while offering a more reasonable selection to both clients and barbers.  	
      <br>
      <br>
       <b>Improved landing page</b>
        <br>
				We can redesign our landing page to quickly resonate with the concerns we‚Äôve uncovered with the team. The new landing page can address the main concerns throughout the customer journey: finding a barber, receiving the haircut at home, the cleanup, and rebooking.

    	<b>Barber-to-client messaging</b>
      <br>
				In order to improve transparency and reduce the personalization of our booking process, we can allow clients to message barbers. This allows them to discuss their hair, availability etc.        <br>
        <br>
    	<b>Matching based on hairstyle</b>
      <br>
				During our interviews we‚Äôve noticed that client want a barber experienced in their hairstyle. We can set up a match making feature to match clients with barbers based on their inputed preferences and pictures. Only a barber that has reviewed the client‚Äôs desired haircut would be matched.      <br>
      <br>
       <b>Selection based on hairstyle</b>
        <br>
					A Yelp like selection that allows clients to pick their barber based on his/her profile. The profile can include pictures, descriptions, and reviews.     </td>

    	<b>New rebooking mechanism</b>
      <br>
			After a user has completed his first haircut, he can return to our website and select to rebook without the need to go through their menu or booking process. We can provide a button to rebook with their favorite barber anywhere on our website.

    	<b>Barber profiles</b>
      <br>
			Rather than visiting our landing page users could directly rebook through our barber‚Äôs unique profile.
